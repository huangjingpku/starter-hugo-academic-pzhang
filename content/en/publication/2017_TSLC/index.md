abstract = "In liquid crystals, the existing experiments and simulations suggest that for various types of molecules: no homogeneous phase is found breaking the molecular symmetry. It has been proved for rod-like molecules. We conjecture that it holds for two types of two-fold symmetries, and prove it for some molecules with these symmetries."
