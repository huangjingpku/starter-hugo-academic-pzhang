abstract = "We study reduced nematic equilibria on regular two-dimensional polygons with Dirichlet tangent boundary conditions, in a reduced two-dimensional framework, discussing their relevance in the full three-dimensional framework too. We work at a fixed temperature and study the reduced stable equilibria in terms of the edge length, $lambda$ of the regular polygon, $E_K$ with $K$ edges. We analytically compute a novel \"ring solution\" in the $lambda to 0$ limit, with a unique point defect at the centre of the polygon for $K neq 4$. The ring solution is unique. For sufficiently large $lambda$, we deduce the existence of at least $left[K/2 right]$ classes of stable equilibria and numerically compute bifurcation diagrams for reduced equilibria on a pentagon and hexagon, as a function of $lambda^2$, thus illustrating the effects of geometry on the structure, locations and dimensionality of defects in this framework."
