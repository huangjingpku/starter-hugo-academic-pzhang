abstract = "We consider approximations on SO(3) by Wigner D-matrix. We establish basic approximation properties of Wigner D-matrix, develop efficient numerical schemes using Wigner D-matrix for elliptic and parabolic equations on SO(3), and establish corresponding optimal error estimates. Numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical estimates and illustrate a physical application."
