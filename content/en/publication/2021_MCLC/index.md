abstract = "Liquid crystal is a typical kind of soft matter that is intermediate between crystalline solids and isotropic fluids. The study of liquid crystals has made tremendous progress over the last four decades, which is of great importance on both fundamental scientific researches and widespread applications in industry. In this paper, we review the mathematical models and their connections of liquid crystals, and survey the developments of numerical methods for finding the rich configurations of liquid crystals."
