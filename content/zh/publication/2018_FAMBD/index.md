abstract = "We propose a fast algorithm for evaluating the moments of Bingham distribution. The calculation is done by piecewise rational approximation, where interpolation and Gaussian integrals are utilized. Numerical tests show that the algorithm reaches the maximum absolute error less than 5 × 10−8 remarkably faster than adaptive numerical quadrature. We apply the algorithm to a model for liquid crystals with the Bingham distribution to examine the defect patterns of rod-like molecules confined in a sphere, and find a different pattern from the Landau-de Gennes theory."
