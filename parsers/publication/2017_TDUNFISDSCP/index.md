abstract = "We present numerical solutions to the Landau-de Gennes free-energy model under the one-constant approximation for systems of single and double spherical colloidal particles immersed in an otherwise uniformly aligned nematic liquid crystal. A perfect homeotropic surface anchoring of liquid-crystal molecules on the spherical surface is considered. A large parameter space is carefully examined, including those in the free-energy model and those describing the dimer configurations and the background liquid-crystal orientation. The stability of the resulting liquid-crystal defects appearing in the neighborhood of the colloidal dimer pair is analyzed in light of the numerical results for their free energies. A number of scenarios are considered: a free dimer pair in a nematic fluid where the free-energy ground states are described in terms of a phase diagram, and a constrained dimer pair where the interparticle distance and the relative orientation of the distance vector to the nematic director can be manipulated. We pay particular attention to the nonsymmetric solutions, which yield several metastable defect states that can be observed in real systems. The high-precision numerical calculations are based on a spectral method, which is an enabling factor that allows us to compare the subtle difference in the free energies of different defect structures."
