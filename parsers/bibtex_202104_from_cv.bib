Defects in liquid crystals are of great practical importance and theoretical
interest. Despite tremendous efforts, predicting the location and transition of defects
under various topological constraint and external field remains to be a challenge.
We investigate defect patterns of nematic liquid crystals confined in threedimensional
spherical droplet and two-dimensional disk under different boundary
conditions, within the Landau-de Gennes model. We implement a spectral method
that numerically solves the Landau-de Gennes model with high accuracy, which allows
us to study the detailed static structure of defects. We observe five types of defect
structures. Among them the 1/2-disclination lines are the most stable structure at low
temperature. Inspired by numerical results, we obtain the profile of disclination lines
analytically. Moreover, the connection and difference between defect patterns under
the Landau-de Gennes model and the Oseen-Frank model are discussed. Finally, three
conjectures are made to summarize some important characteristics of defects in the
Landau-de Gennes theory. This work is a continuing effort to deepen our understanding
on defect patterns in nematic liquid crystals.}

the model. In the latter approach, we apply the projection method to deal with the potentially

and size of higher-dimensional periodic cell is developed to minimize the free energy
with respect to the order parameters. Based on the developed numerical methods,
we rediscover decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystalline phases, and find diverse
periodic phases and complex modulated phases. Furthermore, phase diagrams are
obtained in various phase spaces by comparing the free energies of different candidate
structures. It does show not only the important roles of system parameters, but also
the effect of optimizing computational domain. In particular, the optimization of computational
cell allows us to capture the ground states and phase behavior with higher

configuration, which corresponds to the dipole in a nematic, without outside confinement.
This configuration is energetically preferable to the twisted Saturn ring
when the particle size is large compared to the nematic coherence length and small
compared to the cholesteric pitch. When the colloidal particle imposes strong planar
anchoring, we find the cholesteric twist can result in a split of the defect core
on the particle surface similar to that found in a nematic liquid crystal by lowering
temperature or increasing particle size.},

homeotropic anchoring, we find three different configurations: uniaxial hedgehog, ring
and split-core, in both cases with or without the anisotropic energy. For the
mirror-homeotropic anchoring, there are also three analogue solutions: the uniaxial
hyperbolic hedgehog, ring and split-core for the isotropic energy case. However, when
the anisotropic energy is taken into account, the numerical results and rigorous analysis
reveal that the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog is no longer a solution. Indeed, we find
ring solution only for negative L2 (the elastic coefficient of the anisotropic energy),
while both split-core and ring solutions can be stable minimizers for positive L2. More
precisely, the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog for L2 = 0 bifurcates to a split-core solution
when L2 increases and to a ring solution when L2 decreases. This example shows that
the anisotropic energy may significantly affect the symmetry of point defects with
degree −1 whenever it is introduced.}

at the boundary. Recently the study of defects has drawn a lot of attention because
of the growing theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, we investigate the
relationship between two-dimensional defects and three-dimensional defects within
nematic liquid crystals confined in a shell. A highly accurate spectral method is used
to solve the Landau-de Gennes model to get the detailed static structures of defects.
Interestingly, the solution is radial-invariant when the thickness of the shell is sufficiently
small. As the shell thickness increases, the solution undergoes symmetry break
to reconfigure the disclination lines. We study this three-dimensional reconfiguration
of disclination lines in detail under different boundary conditions. In particular, we
find that the temperature plays an important role in deciding whether the transition
between two-dimensional defects and three-dimensional defects is continuous or discontinuous
for the shell with planar anchoring condition on both inner and outer surfaces.
We also discuss the characterization of defects in two- and three-dimensional
spaces within the tensor model.},

nematic fluid where the free-energy ground states are described in terms of a phase diagram, and a constrained
dimer pair where the interparticle distance and the relative orientation of the distance vector to the nematic
director can be manipulated. We pay particular attention to the nonsymmetric solutions, which yield several
metastable defect states that can be observed in real systems. The high-precision numerical calculations are based

abstract = {We investigate the possible structures of three-dimensional colloidal crystals formed when these
spherical particles are dispersed in a liquid crystal. The case of a strong homeotropic boundary
condition is considered here. Their corresponding defect structures in the space-filler nematic liquid
crystal are induced by the presence of the spherical surface of the colloids and produce an attraction
between colloidal particles. Here, a standard Landau–de Gennes free energy model for a spatially
inhomogeneous liquid crystal is numerically minimized to yield an optimal configuration of both
spherical colloids and the orientational field. The stable and metastable structures obtained in this work
are described and analyzed according to the type of periodic liquid-crystal defect lines that couple the
colloidal spheres together. A large range of the spherical size is covered in this study, corresponding to
a 5CB-liquid-crystal comparison for assembling micron- to nano-sized colloidal spheres. Multiple
configurations are found for each given particle size and the most stable state is determined by a
comparison of the free energies. From large to small colloidal particles, a sequence of structures,
which range from quasi-one-dimensional (columnar), to quasi-two-dimensional (planar), and to truly
three-dimensional, are found to exist.},

Then we incorporate an Onsager-theory-based static tensor model to obtain the dynamic molecular model fully
determined by the molecular architecture. The tensor model is obtained by adopting the quasi-equilibrium
approximation that maintains energy dissipation. For bent-core molecules and star molecules that have the same
molecular symmetry, the form of the model is identical. The molecular architecture is differentiated by the
coefficients that are derived as functions of molecular parameters. Numerical simulation is carried out for the
shear flow problem using both the molecular and the tensor models, focusing on the effect of altering molecular
architecture. When the equilibrium phase is biaxial, novel flow modes are found, and the flow mode sequences
show delicate dependence on the molecular architecture. The tensor model proves to exhibit all the flow modes
found in the molecular model.},

elastic properties. Most of the studies focused on the elastic properties of fluid membranes, despite the
ubiquitous presence of membranes with liquid-crystalline order. Here the elastic properties of liquidcrystalline
bilayers self-assembled from diblock copolymers composed of a semiflexible block are
studied theoretically. Specifically, the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is applied to a model system
composed of semiflexible–flexible diblock copolymers dissolved in flexible homopolymers that act as
solvents. The free energy of self-assembled tensionless bilayer membranes in three different geometries,
i.e. planar, cylindrical and spherical, is obtained by solving the SCFT equations using a hybrid method, in
which the orientation-dependent functions are treated using the spherical harmonics, whereas the
position-dependent operators are treated using the compact difference schemes. The bending modulus
kM and Gaussian modulus kG of the bilayer are extracted from the free energies. The effects of the
molecular parameters of the system, such as the chain rigidity and the orientational interaction, are
systematically examined.},

abstract = {In this paper, the model output machine learning (MOML) method is proposed for simulating weather consultation,
which can improve the forecast results of numerical weather prediction (NWP). During weather consultation, the
forecasters obtain the final results by combining the observations with the NWP results and giving opinions based on their
experience. It is obvious that using a suitable post-processing algorithm for simulating weather consultation is an interesting
and important topic. MOML is a post-processing method based on machine learning, which matches NWP forecasts against
observations through a regression function. By adopting different feature engineering of datasets and training periods, the
observational and model data can be processed into the corresponding training set and test set. The MOML regression
function uses an existing machine learning algorithm with the processed dataset to revise the output of NWP models
combined with the observations, so as to improve the results of weather forecasts. To test the new approach for grid
temperature forecasts, the 2-m surface air temperature in the Beijing area from the ECMWF model is used. MOML with
different feature engineering is compared against the ECMWF model and modified model output statistics (MOS) method.
MOML shows a better numerical performance than the ECMWF model and MOS, especially for winter. The results of
MOML with a linear algorithm, running training period, and dataset using spatial interpolation ideas, are better than others
when the forecast time is within a few days. The results of MOML with the Random Forest algorithm, year-round training
period, and dataset containing surrounding gridpoint information, are better when the forecast time is longer.},

abstract = {Confined nematic liquid crystals can admit multiple stable equilibria. These equilibrium
states usually exhibit peculiar defect patterns in order to satisfy the topological constraints
imposed by the boundary conditions. In this work, we systematically investigate transition
pathways between different stable equilibria of nematic liquid crystals confined in a
cylinder with homeotropic boundary condition. To do so, we implement spectral method
to minimize the Landau-de Gennes free energy and develop a multiscale string method to
accurately compute both minimal energy path and transition state. We first compute the
transition pathways under the assumption that system state is invariant along the axial
direction of the cylinder. This axial invariant assumption allows us to reduce the simulation
domain to a two-dimensional disk. We subsequently remove the axial invariant assumption
to search the transition pathways in the three-dimensional cylinder. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that there exists a threshold for the cylinder height above which a dominolike
transition pathway is more energetically favored than the axial invariant transition
pathway. Moreover, we show that the transition pathway from escape radial with ring
defects (ERRD) to escape radial has a lower energy barrier than the one from ERRD to
planar polar, even though the free energy of the planar polar state is lower than that of
the escape radial state. Our approach provides an accurate and efficient method to compute
minimal energy path and transition state of confined nematic liquid crystals.},

The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rapidly formed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections and huge economic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track, detect and isolate infected people are among the most effective means to quickly contain the outbreak. Based on trajectory big data and the theory of mean-field, we establish an aggregated risk mean=field that contains information of all risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency enabling fast update. We then propose an objective personal epidemic risk scoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps, and use it to develop statistical inference based method and machine learning based method for detecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as at hospital and station. HiRES-p score is an effective measurement of personal epidemic risk. The detection rates as de ned by successful classification are above 90% as long as the population infection rate is under 20%, which indicates great application potential in epidemic risk prevention and control practice.},
