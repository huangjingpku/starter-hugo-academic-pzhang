Here we introduce a general numerical method that constructs the pathway map, which guides our understanding of how a physical system moves on the energy landscape. The method identifies the transition state between energy minima and the energy barrier associated with such a state.

The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rapidly formed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections and huge economic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track, detect and isolate infected people are among the most effective means to quickly contain the outbreak. Based on trajectory big data and the theory of mean-field, we establish an aggregated risk mean=field that contains information of all risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency enabling fast update. We then propose an objective personal epidemic risk scoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps, and use it to develop statistical inference based method and machine learning based method for detecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as at hospital and station. HiRES-p score is an effective measurement of personal epidemic risk. The detection rates as de ned by successful classification are above 90% as long as the population infection rate is under 20%, which indicates great application potential in epidemic risk prevention and control practice.","tags":null,"title":"Detecting Suspected Epidemic Cases Using Trajectory Big Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yucen Han","Jianyuan Yin","Pingwen Zhang","Apala Majumdar","Lei Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f03308ae7c4edafa0f4569a230721db6","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2020_slnlcch/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2020_slnlcch/","section":"publication","summary":"We study reduced nematic equilibria on regular two-dimensional polygons with Dirichlet tangent boundary conditions, in a reduced two-dimensional framework, discussing their relevance in the full three-dimensional framework too. We work at a fixed temperature and study the reduced stable equilibria in terms of the edge length, $lambda$ of the regular polygon, $E_K$ with $K$ edges. We analytically compute a novel \"ring solution\" in the $lambda to 0$ limit, with a unique point defect at the centre of the polygon for $K neq 4$. The ring solution is unique. For sufficiently large $lambda$, we deduce the existence of at least $left[K/2 right]$ classes of stable equilibria and numerically compute bifurcation diagrams for reduced equilibria on a pentagon and hexagon, as a function of $lambda^2$, thus illustrating the effects of geometry on the structure, locations and dimensionality of defects in this framework.","tags":null,"title":"Solution landscapes of nematic liquid crystals confined on a hexagon","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

During weather consultation, the forecasters obtain the final results by combining the observations with the NWP results and giving opinions based on their experience. It is obvious that using a suitable post-processing algorithm for simulating weather consultation is an interesting and important topic. MOML is a post-processing method based on machine learning, which matches NWP forecasts against observations through a regression function. By adopting different feature engineering of datasets and training periods, the observational and model data can be processed into the corresponding training set and test set. The MOML regression function uses an existing machine learning algorithm with the processed dataset to revise the output of NWP models combined with the observations, so as to improve the results of weather forecasts. To test the new approach for grid temperature forecasts, the 2-m surface air temperature in the Beijing area from the ECMWF model is used. MOML with different feature engineering is compared against the ECMWF model and modified model output statistics (MOS) method.

Most of the studies focused on the elastic properties of fluid membranes, despite the ubiquitous presence of membranes with liquid-crystalline order. Here the elastic properties of liquidcrystalline bilayers self-assembled from diblock copolymers composed of a semiflexible block are studied theoretically. Specifically, the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is applied to a model system composed of semiflexible–flexible diblock copolymers dissolved in flexible homopolymers that act as solvents. The free energy of self-assembled tensionless bilayer membranes in three different geometries, i.e. planar, cylindrical and spherical, is obtained by solving the SCFT equations using a hybrid method, in which the orientation-dependent functions are treated using the spherical harmonics, whereas the position-dependent operators are treated using the compact difference schemes. The bending modulus kM and Gaussian modulus kG of the bilayer are extracted from the free energies. The effects of the molecular parameters of the system, such as the chain rigidity and the orientational interaction, are systematically examined.","tags":null,"title":"Elastic properties of liquid-crystalline bilayers self-assembled from semiflexible-flexible deblock copolymers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianyuan Yin","Lei Zhang","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"5b34021fa84fe200b23f06aae5c34ebf","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2019_hosdmfhsp/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2019_hosdmfhsp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"High-index Optimization-based Shrinking Dimer Method for Finding High-Index Saddle Points","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"7de37d43a1d71c571af88db79c20393e","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/students/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/students/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c47153ce37fc454158e5fe9a9fda9253","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/test/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/test/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Yucen Han","Yucheng Hu","Pingwen Zhang","Lei Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2f0b2b474eee3460625b1947d2734aad","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2019_tpbdpcnlc/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2019_tpbdpcnlc/","section":"publication","summary":"Confined nematic liquid crystals can admit multiple stable equilibria. These equilibrium states usually exhibit peculiar defect patterns in order to satisfy the topological constraints imposed by the boundary conditions. In this work, we systematically investigate transition pathways between different stable equilibria of nematic liquid crystals confined in a cylinder with homeotropic boundary condition. To do so, we implement spectral method to minimize the Landau-de Gennes free energy and develop a multiscale string method to accurately compute both minimal energy path and transition state. We first compute the transition pathways under the assumption that system state is invariant along the axial direction of the cylinder. This axial invariant assumption allows us to reduce the simulation domain to a two-dimensional disk. We subsequently remove the axial invariant assumption to search the transition pathways in the three-dimensional cylinder. Numerical simulations demonstrate that there exists a threshold for the cylinder height above which a dominolike transition pathway is more energetically favored than the axial invariant transition pathway. Moreover, we show that the transition pathway from escape radial with ring defects (ERRD) to escape radial has a lower energy barrier than the one from ERRD to planar polar, even though the free energy of the planar polar state is lower than that of the escape radial state. Our approach provides an accurate and efficient method to compute minimal energy path and transition state of confined nematic liquid crystals.","tags":null,"title":"Transition pathways between defect patterns in confined nematic liquid crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixiang Luo","Jie Xu","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1175398f62276c0726a058a9ee9c74b9","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2018_fambd/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2018_fambd/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a fast algorithm for evaluating the moments of Bingham distribution.

However, when the anisotropic energy is taken into account, the numerical results and rigorous analysis reveal that the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog is no longer a solution. Indeed, we find ring solution only for negative L2 (the elastic coefficient of the anisotropic energy), while both split-core and ring solutions can be stable minimizers for positive L2. More precisely, the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog for L2 = 0 bifurcates to a split-core solution when L2 increases and to a ring solution when L2 decreases.

A perfect homeotropic surface anchoring of liquid-crystal molecules on the spherical surface is considered. A large parameter space is carefully examined, including those in the free-energy model and those describing the dimer configurations and the background liquid-crystal orientation. The stability of the resulting liquid-crystal defects appearing in the neighborhood of the colloidal dimer pair is analyzed in light of the numerical results for their free energies. A number of scenarios are considered: a free dimer pair in a nematic fluid where the free-energy ground states are described in terms of a phase diagram, and a constrained dimer pair where the interparticle distance and the relative orientation of the distance vector to the nematic director can be manipulated. We pay particular attention to the nonsymmetric solutions, which yield several metastable defect states that can be observed in real systems. The high-precision numerical calculations are based on a spectral method, which is an enabling factor that allows us to compare the subtle difference in the free energies of different defect structures.","tags":null,"title":"Topological Defects in an Unconfined Nematic Fluid Induced by Single and Double Spherical Colloidal Particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Qu","Ying Wei","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6c35c4238fce3188c05f1fbae68abb95","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2017_tdp23lc/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2017_tdp23lc/","section":"publication","summary":"Defects arise when nematic liquid crystals are under topological constraints at the boundary. Recently the study of defects has drawn a lot of attention because of the growing theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two-dimensional defects and three-dimensional defects within nematic liquid crystals confined in a shell. A highly accurate spectral method is used to solve the Landau-de Gennes model to get the detailed static structures of defects. Interestingly, the solution is radial-invariant when the thickness of the shell is sufficiently small. As the shell thickness increases, the solution undergoes symmetry break to reconfigure the disclination lines. We study this three-dimensional reconfiguration of disclination lines in detail under different boundary conditions. In particular, we find that the temperature plays an important role in deciding whether the transition between two-dimensional defects and three-dimensional defects is continuous or discontinuous for the shell with planar anchoring condition on both inner and outer surfaces. We also discuss the characterization of defects in two- and three-dimensional spaces within the tensor model.","tags":null,"title":"Transition of Defect Patterns from 2D to 3D in Liquid Crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiwei Ye","Pingwen Zhang","Je Z.Y.

The role played by surface curvature, which couples to the molecular rigidity, is reported as the main reason that causes the weak nematic ordering in an otherwise ordinary isotropic phase. The same coupling has a profound effect on the nematic states as well, which are stabilized by the Onsager excluded-volume interaction; the latter has been frequently used to study lyotropic liquid crystal polymers and is used here as an example of the physical mechanisms that drive the system to make orientational ordering. We identify important parameters in the system which are used as axes of the fourdimensional phase diagram.

Despite tremendous efforts, predicting the location and transition of defects under various topological constraint and external field remains to be a challenge. We investigate defect patterns of nematic liquid crystals confined in threedimensional spherical droplet and two-dimensional disk under different boundary conditions, within the Landau-de Gennes model. We implement a spectral method that numerically solves the Landau-de Gennes model with high accuracy, which allows us to study the detailed static structure of defects. We observe five types of defect structures. Among them the 1/2-disclination lines are the most stable structure at low temperature. Inspired by numerical results, we obtain the profile of disclination lines analytically. Moreover, the connection and difference between defect patterns under the Landau-de Gennes model and the Oseen-Frank model are discussed. Finally, three conjectures are made to summarize some important characteristics of defects in the Landau-de Gennes theory. This work is a continuing effort to deepen our understanding on defect patterns in nematic liquid crystals.","tags":null,"title":"On the Disclination Lines of Nematic Liquid Crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Jiang","Jiajun Tong","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"c79289be6550d230b2f5aae422525a34","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2016_ssqcsmts/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2016_ssqcsmts/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we discuss the stability of soft quasicrystalline phases in a coupled-mode Swift-Hohenberg model for three-component systems, where the characteristic length scales are governed by the positive-definite gradient terms. Classic two-mode approximation method and direct numerical minimization are applied to the model. In the latter approach, we apply the projection method to deal with the potentially quasiperiodic ground states. A variable cell method of optimizing the shape and size of higher-dimensional periodic cell is developed to minimize the free energy with respect to the order parameters. Based on the developed numerical methods, we rediscover decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystalline phases, and find diverse periodic phases and complex modulated phases. Furthermore, phase diagrams are obtained in various phase spaces by comparing the free energies of different candidate structures. It does show not only the important roles of system parameters, but also the effect of optimizing computational domain. In particular, the optimization of computational cell allows us to capture the ground states and phase behavior with higher fidelity. We also make some discussions on our results and show the potential of applying our numerical methods to a larger class of mean-field free energy functionals.","tags":null,"title":"Stability of Soft Quasicrystals in a Coupled-Mode Swift-Hohenberg Model for Three-Component Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiwei Ye","Pingwen Zhang","Je Z.Y.
