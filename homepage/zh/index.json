The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rapidly formed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections and huge economic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track, detect and isolate infected people are among the most effective means to quickly contain the outbreak. Based on trajectory big data and the theory of mean-field, we establish an aggregated risk mean=field that contains information of all risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency enabling fast update. We then propose an objective personal epidemic risk scoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps, and use it to develop statistical inference based method and machine learning based method for detecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as at hospital and station. HiRES-p score is an effective measurement of personal epidemic risk. The detection rates as de ned by successful classification are above 90% as long as the population infection rate is under 20%, which indicates great application potential in epidemic risk prevention and control practice.","tags":null,"title":"Detecting Suspected Epidemic Cases Using Trajectory Big Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yucen Han","殷鉴远","Pingwen Zhang","Apala Majumdar","张 磊"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f03308ae7c4edafa0f4569a230721db6","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/zh/publication/2020_slnlcch/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/zh/publication/2020_slnlcch/","section":"publication","summary":"We study reduced nematic equilibria on regular two-dimensional polygons with Dirichlet tangent boundary conditions, in a reduced two-dimensional framework, discussing their relevance in the full three-dimensional framework too.

During weather consultation, the forecasters obtain the final results by combining the observations with the NWP results and giving opinions based on their experience. It is obvious that using a suitable post-processing algorithm for simulating weather consultation is an interesting and important topic. MOML is a post-processing method based on machine learning, which matches NWP forecasts against observations through a regression function. By adopting different feature engineering of datasets and training periods, the observational and model data can be processed into the corresponding training set and test set. The MOML regression function uses an existing machine learning algorithm with the processed dataset to revise the output of NWP models combined with the observations, so as to improve the results of weather forecasts. To test the new approach for grid temperature forecasts, the 2-m surface air temperature in the Beijing area from the ECMWF model is used. MOML with different feature engineering is compared against the ECMWF model and modified model output statistics (MOS) method. MOML shows a better numerical performance than the ECMWF model and MOS, especially for winter. The results of MOML with a linear algorithm, running training period, and dataset using spatial interpolation ideas, are better than others when the forecast time is within a few days. The results of MOML with the Random Forest algorithm, year-round training period, and dataset containing surrounding gridpoint information, are better when the forecast time is longer.","tags":null,"title":"A Model Output Machine Learning Method for Grid Temperature Forecasts in the Beijing Area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["田 田","王 涵","Wei Ge","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c1ad00ada1a22ff5f9d7b2bd99567e1f","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/zh/publication/2019_dpcpsdbm/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/zh/publication/2019_dpcpsdbm/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) method is proposed to detect particle clusters in particle-fluid systems.

Most of the studies focused on the elastic properties of fluid membranes, despite the ubiquitous presence of membranes with liquid-crystalline order. Here the elastic properties of liquidcrystalline bilayers self-assembled from diblock copolymers composed of a semiflexible block are studied theoretically. Specifically, the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is applied to a model system composed of semiflexible–flexible diblock copolymers dissolved in flexible homopolymers that act as solvents. The free energy of self-assembled tensionless bilayer membranes in three different geometries, i.e. planar, cylindrical and spherical, is obtained by solving the SCFT equations using a hybrid method, in which the orientation-dependent functions are treated using the spherical harmonics, whereas the position-dependent operators are treated using the compact difference schemes. The bending modulus kM and Gaussian modulus kG of the bilayer are extracted from the free energies. The effects of the molecular parameters of the system, such as the chain rigidity and the orientational interaction, are systematically examined.","tags":null,"title":"Elastic properties of liquid-crystalline bilayers self-assembled from semiflexible-flexible deblock copolymers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["殷鉴远","张 磊","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"5b34021fa84fe200b23f06aae5c34ebf","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/zh/publication/2019_hosdmfhsp/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/zh/publication/2019_hosdmfhsp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"High-index Optimization-based Shrinking Dimer Method for Finding High-Index Saddle Points","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"7de37d43a1d71c571af88db79c20393e","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/zh/students/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/zh/students/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Yucen Han","Yucheng Hu","Pingwen Zhang","张 磊"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2f0b2b474eee3460625b1947d2734aad","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/zh/publication/2019_tpbdpcnlc/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/zh/publication/2019_tpbdpcnlc/","section":"publication","summary":"Confined nematic liquid crystals can admit multiple stable equilibria. These equilibrium states usually exhibit peculiar defect patterns in order to satisfy the topological constraints imposed by the boundary conditions. In this work, we systematically investigate transition pathways between different stable equilibria of nematic liquid crystals confined in a cylinder with homeotropic boundary condition. To do so, we implement spectral method to minimize the Landau-de Gennes free energy and develop a multiscale string method to accurately compute both minimal energy path and transition state. We first compute the transition pathways under the assumption that system state is invariant along the axial direction of the cylinder. This axial invariant assumption allows us to reduce the simulation domain to a two-dimensional disk. We subsequently remove the axial invariant assumption to search the transition pathways in the three-dimensional cylinder. Numerical simulations demonstrate that there exists a threshold for the cylinder height above which a dominolike transition pathway is more energetically favored than the axial invariant transition pathway. Moreover, we show that the transition pathway from escape radial with ring defects (ERRD) to escape radial has a lower energy barrier than the one from ERRD to planar polar, even though the free energy of the planar polar state is lower than that of the escape radial state. Our approach provides an accurate and efficient method to compute minimal energy path and transition state of confined nematic liquid crystals.","tags":null,"title":"Transition pathways between defect patterns in confined nematic liquid crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixiang Luo","徐 劼","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1175398f62276c0726a058a9ee9c74b9","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/zh/publication/2018_fambd/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/zh/publication/2018_fambd/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a fast algorithm for evaluating the moments of Bingham distribution.

When the equilibrium phase is biaxial, novel flow modes are found, and the flow mode sequences show delicate dependence on the molecular architecture. The tensor model proves to exhibit all the flow modes found in the molecular model.","tags":null,"title":"Onsager-theory-based dynamic model for nematic phases of bent-core molecules and star molecules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["徐 劼","Chu Wang","An-Chang Shi","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"04b4e6813f2de0e5c8135941aa0c373d","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/zh/publication/2017_coismp/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/zh/publication/2017_coismp/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a general framework of computing interfacial structures between two modulated phases.

Two typical strong anchoring boundary conditions, namely homeotropic and mirror-homeotropic anchoring conditions, are considered. For the homeotropic anchoring, we find three different configurations: uniaxial hedgehog, ring and split-core, in both cases with or without the anisotropic energy. For the mirror-homeotropic anchoring, there are also three analogue solutions: the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog, ring and split-core for the isotropic energy case. However, when the anisotropic energy is taken into account, the numerical results and rigorous analysis reveal that the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog is no longer a solution. Indeed, we find ring solution only for negative L2 (the elastic coefficient of the anisotropic energy), while both split-core and ring solutions can be stable minimizers for positive L2. More precisely, the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog for L2 = 0 bifurcates to a split-core solution when L2 increases and to a ring solution when L2 decreases. This example shows that the anisotropic energy may significantly affect the symmetry of point defects with degree −1 whenever it is introduced.","tags":null,"title":"On equilibrium configurations of nematic liquid crystals droplet with anisotropic elastic energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinhae Park","王 伟","Pingwen Zhang","Zhifei Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"98871c301a7f45cc2a4866803592fbf5","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/zh/publication/2017_miip/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/zh/publication/2017_miip/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we investigate the structure and stability of the isotropic-nematic interface in 1-D.

Recently the study of defects has drawn a lot of attention because of the growing theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two-dimensional defects and three-dimensional defects within nematic liquid crystals confined in a shell. A highly accurate spectral method is used to solve the Landau-de Gennes model to get the detailed static structures of defects. Interestingly, the solution is radial-invariant when the thickness of the shell is sufficiently small. As the shell thickness increases, the solution undergoes symmetry break to reconfigure the disclination lines. We study this three-dimensional reconfiguration of disclination lines in detail under different boundary conditions. In particular, we find that the temperature plays an important role in deciding whether the transition between two-dimensional defects and three-dimensional defects is continuous or discontinuous for the shell with planar anchoring condition on both inner and outer surfaces. We also discuss the characterization of defects in two- and three-dimensional spaces within the tensor model.","tags":null,"title":"Transition of Defect Patterns from 2D to 3D in Liquid Crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["叶时炜","Pingwen Zhang","Je Z.Y.

Despite tremendous efforts, predicting the location and transition of defects under various topological constraint and external field remains to be a challenge.

We implement a spectral method that numerically solves the Landau-de Gennes model with high accuracy, which allows us to study the detailed static structure of defects. We observe five types of defect structures. Among them the 1/2-disclination lines are the most stable structure at low temperature. Inspired by numerical results, we obtain the profile of disclination lines analytically. Moreover, the connection and difference between defect patterns under the Landau-de Gennes model and the Oseen-Frank model are discussed.
